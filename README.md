I am a Data Architect specialising in data platforms, this Git repo contains sample data archtiecture / data engineering frameworks and scripts that I created over the years. I am a big fan of meta-data driven frameworks and simplicity. In my eyes technology solutions are as good as their ability to address the business requirements while not compromising key non-functional aspects such as security, reliability, scalability and maintainability. Ingoring simplicity (unless driven from business requirements) inherently leads to compromising the non-functional aspects.
